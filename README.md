# Echo Chamber
A plugin for quick-note taking that borrows affordances from Twitter!

## What's Happening?
Do you need to work but are addicted to social media?
Now, you can _tweet_ and be productive _at the same time_!!!

Simply `Open Post View` and tweet away!

## Cool Features
- Posts can contain any markdown that Obsidian can render — even stuff from third-party plugins!
- You can like your own posts — that does absolutely nothing!
- You can open the post in split-screen for quick editing.

## Issues
As of the moment, rendering of thousands of posts isn't optimal — I don't yet use a virtualized list.

Updates, though, for insertion, deletion and renaming are pretty efficient!
